# SWATH_SUBSAMPLE_DISTANCE = distance between points on the cross-track profiles that build the swath

# $ XYZFILE SWATH_WIDTH ZSCALE GMT_arguments
#
# SWATH_WIDTH is full width of cross-swath profiles.
# XYZ data are projected onto closest approach of track.
# ZSCALE transforms the Z values in the data file to profile Z units in the grid file. (e.g. -1000 takes positive km depth to negative meters)
# GMT_arguments are any number of arguments that will be passed to gmt psxy.
# By default, symbols are filled using the profile color. A GMT_arugment of -C{CPTFILE} that includes an absolute path a CPT will color by the Z value.
# The CPT should be in Z units after ZSCALE is applied. This option will override the default -G{color} fill.

# This is the same as XYZ data, but the logic for plotting using -z in tectoplot (SEISSTRETCH, etc) are applied here.

# WIDTH is full distance of the cross-profile track
# CMT data are projected orthogonally onto the profile line segments using gmt pscoupe. A GMT_argument of -Z{CPTFILE} will color
# focal mechanism compressive axes by depth rather than by profile. Profiles with sharp bends may duplicate mechanisms on overlap areas!
