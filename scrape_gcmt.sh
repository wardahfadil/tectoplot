# This script will download GCMT data in ndk format and produce an initial earthquake catalogs for origin/centroid.
# These catalogs will be modified by scrape_isc_focals_expand.sh to and final GCMT catalogs will be made.

# Outputs 29 space separated fields using ndk2meca_keb_14.sh (which is modified from ndk2meca.sh from Thorsten Becker)
# Note that currently ndk2meca_keb_14.sh outputs the alternative depth as field 14 and we change that to field 29 here
